## Spaghetti Carbonara

A classic Roman pasta dish that's creamy, rich, and satisfying. The secret is in the technique of creating a silky sauce without scrambling the eggs.

### Tips

- Use high-quality pancetta or guanciale for authentic flavor
- Grate the cheese finely for better melting
- Work quickly when combining the egg mixture with hot pasta to avoid scrambling
- Save some pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency if needed
